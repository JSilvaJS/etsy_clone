We are so excited you have decided to &quot;drop&quot; in and browse our items that have all been hand picked by our team (my husband and daughters) and myself. We have chosen each item because it spoke to us, either it reminded us of something from our childhood, or stories we were told growing up. Perhaps it was the beauty we saw beneath the dust, or the one thing peeking out from an old discarded box that had been pushed to the wayside. For whatever countless reason the items you see here on Blue Barn Company&#39;s page all represent something I would be proud to display in my own home (and a lot of the items I do). \r\n\r\nWe take careful consideration before we purchase our items, only buying the best condition possible. We DO NOT alter, fix or repair anything we sell and do not intentionally buy anything that has been fixed, repaired, or altered! If an item has a chip or crack or flaw in it we do our best to photograph the imperfection and make it known in the description. We do not make a habit of buying things with chips or cracks, but on occasion we will if the piece is unusual enough, and lets be honest, sometimes in the excitement of things we can miss a little imperfection!\r\n\r\nWe also want to point out we are not appraisers or antique dealers. We find these treasures then our research and development team (my husband and myself) spend countless hours researching the items and photographing them to make sure we portray our items as accurately and honestly as possible. We want you to fall in love with what you purchase here from us at Blue Barn Company, and we will be more than happy to answer any questions you have BEFORE you purchase your item. If you want measurements, or a different angle of photo taken, whatever you need we are here to make your experience just as wonderful as if you walked into a brick and mortar store, but with the comforts of your own home!\r\n\r\nEverything we sell we have right here in our warehouse (AKA office and barn). So we are not buying stuff and playing the shipping game of when it gets here we will ship to you! Please know that my ultimate goal in starting this business is a passion for antique and vintage items, to preserve them and pass them along to the next generation of people to be loved and cherished. Every item is vintage to antique depending on age. We do not sell &quot;brand new&quot; in the package type items, so please know that every item you get will be pre-loved by someone else. There will be some aging, and slight use visible, this is all normal wear for vintage items. But if you feel we somehow misrepresented an item in ANY way, or you just were not happy after you received it, we here at Blue Barn will be happy to refund your money minus shipping costs and will expedite the refund back to you as soon as we receive the item back in the same condition it left our hands.

If you see an item that you really want but feel shipping is to high, message me with your zip code and I will get an accurate price for you. We would hate to lose a customer over shipping charges! We do not charge any extra handling fees, just what it takes to get the item to you safely.

Please message me for any reason, if you decide you do not want the item, something came up and you cannot purchase it right now, etc. Just communicate with me and be honest and that way no one gets negative reviews or flags. We have all been there, buyers remorse is terrible and I just want you to know it is OK if that happens, try and let me know BEFORE I ship the item, but if it is after then we will work it out.

Gem-quality material has a low iron content, resulting in transparent crystals. Due to its lack of hardness, (3.5-4.0 Mohs), it is mainly a collector&#39;s gemstone. One of the most notable characteristics of sphalerite is its high dispersion (0.156). In fact, the dispersion of sphalerite is over three times that of diamond, which has a dispersion of 0.044. This means that sphalerite has remarkable &quot;fire&quot;; the separation of visible light into colors by refraction or diffraction. In simple terms, this refers to the flashes of color seen when sphalerite is turned in the light. The name &quot;sphalerite&quot; comes from the Greek word, &quot;sphaleros&quot;, which means &quot;deceptive&quot;. Gem quality transparent sphalerite is rare. Sphalerite is typically yellow, orange or red. However new finds in Mongolia and Bulgaria have yielded greens which are the most rare.\n\nBulgarian Sphalerite is the best material available today with colors ranging from whiskey to golden yellows, to vibrant oranges and greens.

Perfect for any ginger in your life!!!\n\nAbout Your New T Shirt\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nI use new Gildan G200 or G500 100% cotton t shirts. (Except Neon Pink which is 50\/50 and Sport Grey which is 90\/10). They are pre-shrunk but you can allow 5% shrinkage for the dryer. They are very true to size. I use a premium vinyl material for the design. It will never crack, peel or fade like you get with screen printing and iron on transfers. Your design will last a long time and you do not have to wash it any special way.\n\nFAQ\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n* I ship orders every day that the Post Office is open. I ship via USPS.\n\n* I stock a pretty good selection of t shirts and onesies, so I can usually get your order out the same or next day.\n\n* The sizing chart is in the pictures. The measurements are the height and width of a t shirt that is laying flat on a surface. (you can measure one of yours to get an idea if you are unsure)\n\n* Sport Grey and White shirts come with a black lettering design. All others come in white lettering or as shown in pictures listed above.\n\n* I can do exchanges. If you accidently order the wrong size then simply send me the old one back   and I will send you out the size you need. (unfortunately you will have to pay the shipping though.)\n\nPlease visit my shop at https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/youngandstyling for more designs.\n\nThanks for visiting!","creation_tsz":1457543551,"ending_tsz":1468080751,"original_creation_tsz":1452194460,"last_modified_tsz":1457543551,"price":"14.99","currency_code":"USD","quantity":95,"tags":["tshirt","t shirt","youngandstyling","clothing","funny t shirt","comedy","fiery redhead","redhead","ginger","whiskey drinking","wild redhead","blonde","brunette"],"category_path":["Clothing","Shirt"],"category_path_ids":[69150353,68889876],"materials":["cotton","100 percent cotton","vinyl","tshirt","t shirt","tee"],"shop_section_id":16455334,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1452194460,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/263023734\/wild-whiskey-drinking-redhead-funny-t?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":39,"num_favorers":2,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":2,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":"unisex_adults","occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":482,"taxonomy_path":["Clothing","Unisex Adult Clothing","Tops & Tees","T-shirts"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":899208681,"hex_code":"DD6F84","red":221,"green":111,"blue":132,"hue":349,"saturation":49,"brightness":86,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1452194461,"listing_id":263023734,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/121\/1\/10140513\/il_75x75.899208681_rm22.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/121\/1\/10140513\/il_170x135.899208681_rm22.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/121\/1\/10140513\/il_570xN.899208681_rm22.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/121\/1\/10140513\/il_fullxfull.899208681_rm22.jpg","full_height":709,"full_width":796},{"listing_image_id":899447870,"hex_code":"737373","red":115,"green":115,"blue":115,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":45,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1452194461,"listing_id":263023734,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/116\/0\/10140513\/il_75x75.899447870_m1hv.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/116\/0\/10140513\/il_170x135.899447870_m1hv.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/116\/0\/10140513\/il_570xN.899447870_m1hv.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/116\/0\/10140513\/il_fullxfull.899447870_m1hv.jpg","full_height":716,"full_width":803},{"listing_image_id":899208769,"hex_code":"7CBC97","red":124,"green":188,"blue":151,"hue":145,"saturation":34,"brightness":73,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1452194461,"listing_id":263023734,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/125\/0\/10140513\/il_75x75.899208769_da4e.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/125\/0\/10140513\/il_170x135.899208769_da4e.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/125\/0\/10140513\/il_570xN.899208769_da4e.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/125\/0\/10140513\/il_fullxfull.899208769_da4e.jpg","full_height":712,"full_width":795},{"listing_image_id":689123124,"hex_code":"B4A8B1","red":180,"green":168,"blue":177,"hue":315,"saturation":6,"brightness":70,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1452194461,"listing_id":263023734,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/055\/0\/10140513\/il_75x75.689123124_ir3c.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/055\/0\/10140513\/il_170x135.689123124_ir3c.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/055\/0\/10140513\/il_570xN.689123124_ir3c.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/055\/0\/10140513\/il_fullxfull.689123124_ir3c.jpg","full_height":632,"full_width":596}],"Shop":{"shop_id":10140513,"shop_name":"youngandstyling","user_id":54752348,"creation_tsz":1413652269,"title":"Unique and Custom Children&#39;s Clothing","announcement":"YoungandStyling offers unique one of a kind custom clothing.
